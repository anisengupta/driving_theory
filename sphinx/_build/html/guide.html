<h1>Step by step guide<a class="headerlink" href="#step-by-step-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Driving Theory repository contains code that creates a bot that is able to complete a multiple choice driving theory test.
The idea came from my own experience where every night I would complete a number of theory tests as preparation leading upto my
to my own real test. I was wondering whether it would be possible to create a bot that would complete the theory test for me by identifying the question
and selecting the right answers.</p>
<p>I wanted to go one step further than just creating a process that can identify answers to questions. I wanted
to set up a system whereby I would simply set the code to run and sit back to watch the bot complete the test for me.
This project therefore heavily relies on the Selenium module which can automate browsers. For more information, please see
this documentation: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">https://www.selenium.dev/</a></p>
<p>The project contains several classes in the file driving_theory.py. Each class represents a step in the process that is
required in order for the bot to function.</p>
<div class="section" id="classes">
<h2>Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>AnswerSearch</strong>: searches for the right answer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ImageDetection</strong>: searches for an image in the question</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ImageAnswers</strong>: obtains the answers from image questions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CorrectAnswer</strong>: attempts to determine the correct answer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>StartTest</strong>: starts the actual multiple choice test</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging</strong>: logs all important messages</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-process-guide">
<h2>The Process Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#the-process-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will now describe the general process undertaken. This is the simplest case, where the bot opens
the correct webpage, identifies the question, determines that there are no pictorial questions or answers
and executes the steps to answer that question.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1">
<h3>Step 1<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step to consider is to start the test and navigate our way to the page.
The class <strong>StartTest</strong> contains a <em>open_webpage</em> function which takes in a URL and a
<em>start_xpath</em> parameter. This is the start button of the page to be clicked on:</p>
<img alt="_images/start_test.png" src="_images/start_test.png" />
<p>We also make an image bank of highway code images (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs</a>)
which we will make use of later once we encounter pictorial questions:</p>
<img alt="_images/highway_code_image_bank.png" src="_images/highway_code_image_bank.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2">
<h3>Step 2<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second step, once the test has been started, is to identify the question:</p>
<img alt="_images/identify_question.png" src="_images/identify_question.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Step 2<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The bot then identifies the choices it is presented to the question and stores
the answers in a dictionary along with its respective ids:</p>
<img alt="_images/identify_choices.png" src="_images/identify_choices.png" />
<img alt="_images/choices_dict.png" src="_images/choices_dict.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3">
<h3>Step 3<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The bot then performs as a human would if they do not know the answer to the question; it Googles it:</p>
<img alt="_images/google_answer.png" src="_images/google_answer.png" />
<img alt="_images/answer.png" src="_images/answer.png" />
<p>It then uses the NLTK module to dissect the answer into its relevant topics:</p>
<img alt="_images/answer_processed.png" src="_images/answer_processed.png" />
<p>For more information into this module and its amazing capabilities, please see its documentation:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nltk.org/">https://www.nltk.org/</a></p>
<p>For each answer identified, it splits into n-grams. These are a set of co-occurring words within
a given window. When computing them, you typically move one word forward. N-grams are very useful
in developing language models and we have made them useful here as here to determine which multiple
choice is the closest matching to the answer.</p>
<img alt="_images/answer_grams.png" src="_images/answer_grams.png" />
<p>Then for each answer, the bot creates a score based on how many grams appear in the processed answer:</p>
<img alt="_images/score_dict.png" src="_images/score_dict.png" />
<p>We construct a dictionary of unigrams, bigrams and the full string choice. The process then looks
for each subgram in the gram dictionary within the answer. The more subgrams that are found in the answer,
the more points are awarded. If the full string is found in the answer, the process awards the choice
the maximum number of points.</p>
<p>A check is then executed to evaluate if there are duplicate answers in the score dictionary,
if no duplicate answers are present, an answer is obtained with the highest score:</p>
<img alt="_images/correct_answer.png" src="_images/correct_answer.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4">
<h3>Step 4<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In every step executed by the bot, it logs the information into a text file to be consulted later.
Once the bot has completed, the text file log is then available to view as a means of seeing
which questions were identified, which choices were identified and how the bot proceeded to answer them:</p>
<img alt="_images/log.png" src="_images/log.png" />
<p>Note that you do have to provide a <strong>filepath</strong> for the log file to be created.</p>
<p>We will now explain three unique cases which are alternate paths of execution, there are more cases
that are handled than these, so please feel free to consult the code base if you are interested
and want to dive deeper.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-duplicate-answers">
<h2>Case - Duplicate Answers<a class="headerlink" href="#case-duplicate-answers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will now consider the first unique case; this is when the bot executes the process outlined above
as usual but encounters duplicate answers with the same scores:</p>
<img alt="_images/score_dict_duplicate.png" src="_images/score_dict_duplicate.png" />
<p>The function <em>obtain_correct_answer</em> in the class <strong>CorrectAnswer</strong> takes this into account by using
the Regex library and employing the function <em>findall</em>. It then uses a similar logic of the n-grams process
and awards scores to each duplicate answer based on how many times they appear in the correct answer
obtained from a Google search.</p>
<p>For more information on the Regex library, please see the relevant documentation (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-image-answers">
<h2>Case - Image Answers<a class="headerlink" href="#case-image-answers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will now touch upon the case about what the bot does when it encounters answers that are
images. These are quite common in the Driving Theory test as a common question would be
'Which sign means...?':</p>
<img alt="_images/image_choices.png" src="_images/image_choices.png" />
<p>As discussed above, when the bot is presented with a new page, it identifies the question and the
answer choices. The method of creating a choices dictionary only works if the choices presented
contain text. A process in place then evaluates whether or not this dictionary is empty; if it is
then this means that the choices are images, not text:</p>
<img alt="_images/choices_dict_empty.png" src="_images/choices_dict_empty.png" />
<p>An evaluation process then takes place and outputs a bool. If <strong>True</strong>, then the choices dictionary is
indeed empty and an alternate process is executed:</p>
<img alt="_images/choices_dict_eval.png" src="_images/choices_dict_eval.png" />
<p>This alternate process makes another dictionary with captions to each image, it uses the
Highway Code Image Bank created at the beginning of the process:</p>
<img alt="_images/captions_dict.png" src="_images/captions_dict.png" />
<p>In the event that it cannot find a caption to the image, a fallback caption will be returned: <em>'No caption found'</em></p>
<p>The process then analyses the question and returns the caption that is the closest matching answer:</p>
<img alt="_images/correct_answer_image_question.png" src="_images/correct_answer_image_question.png" />
<p>It then executes the rest of the process by analysing the n-grams and matching to the original question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-image-question">
<h2>Case - Image Question<a class="headerlink" href="#case-image-question" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final case we will touch upon is also another common one; what does the bot do in the event that
it encounters an image question with text answers:</p>
<img alt="_images/image_question.png" src="_images/image_question.png" />
<p>In this instance, the alternate process is similar to the case of Image Answers. However in this case,
the choices dictionary that will be created will not be empty as the answer choices themselves are
texts, not images:</p>
<img alt="_images/choices_dict1.png" src="_images/choices_dict1.png" />
<p>The process then looks through the Highway Code Image Bank to see if it can obtain a caption, in the event
that it cannot, it will obtain a new tab on Google and perform an image search instead:</p>
<img alt="_images/google_search_image.png" src="_images/google_search_image.png" />
<img alt="_images/image_question_answer.png" src="_images/image_question_answer.png" />
<p>Once an answer has been obtained, the rest of the process is then executed to obtain a correct answer.</p>
